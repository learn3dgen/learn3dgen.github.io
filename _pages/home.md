    <p>
      The past several years have seen an explosion of interest in generative modeling: unsupervised models which learn to synthesize new elements from the training data domain. Such models have been used to breathtaking effect for generating realistic images, especially of human faces, which are in some cases indistinguishable from reality. The unsupervised latent representations learned by these models can also prove powerful when used as feature sets for supervised learning tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, the vision community's attention has mostly focused on generative models of 2D images. However, in computer graphics, there has been a recent surge of activity in generative models of three-dimensional content: learnable models which can synthesize novel 3D objects, or even larger scenes composed of multiple objects. As the vision community turns from passive internet-images based vision toward more <i>embodied</i> vision tasks, these kinds of 3D generative models become increasingly important: as unsupervised feature learners, as training data synthesizers, as a platform to study 3D representations for 3D vision tasks, and as a way of equipping an embodied agent with a 3D `imagination' about the kinds of objects and scenes it might encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
     With this workshop, we aim to bring together researchers working on generative models of 3D shapes and scenes with researchers and practitioners who can use these generative models to improve embodied vision tasks. For our purposes, we define ``generative model'' to include methods that synthesize geometry unconditionally as well as from sensory inputs (e.g. images), language, or other high-level specifications. Vision tasks that can benefit from such models include scene classification and segmentation, 3D reconstruction, human activity recognition, robotic visual navigation, question answering, and more.

      <b><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/">Jitendra Malik</a></b> received the B.Tech degree in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in 1980 and the PhD degree in Computer Science from Stanford University in 1985. In January 1986, he joined the university of California at Berkeley, where he is currently the Arthur J. Chick Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. Since January 2018, he is also Research Director and Site Lead of Facebook AI Research in Menlo Park. Prof. Malik's research group has worked on many different topics in computer vision, computational modeling of human vision, computer graphics and the analysis of biological images. Several well-known concepts and algorithms arose in this research, such as anisotropic diffusion, normalized cuts, high dynamic range imaging, shape contexts and R-CNN. He has mentored more than 60 PhD students and postdoctoral fellows. His publications have received numerous best paper awards, including five test of time awards - the Longuet-Higgins Prize for papers published at CVPR (twice) and the Helmholtz Prize for papers published at ICCV (three times). He received the 2013 IEEE PAMI-TC Distinguished Researcher in Computer Vision Award, the 2014 K.S. Fu Prize from the International Association of Pattern Recognition, the 2016 ACM-AAAI Allen Newell Award, the 2018 IJCAI Award for Research Excellence in AI, and the 2019 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award. He is a fellow of the IEEE and the ACM. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

      <b><a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/aliaga/">Daniel Aliaga</a></b> does research primarily in the area of 3D computer graphics but overlaps with computer vision and visualization while also having strong multi-disciplinary collaborations outside of computer science. His research activities are divided into three groups: a) his pioneering work in the multi-disciplinary area of inverse modeling and design; b) his first-of-its-kind work in codifying information into images and surfaces, and c) his compelling work in a visual computing framework including high-quality 3D acquisition methods. Dr. Aliaga’s inverse modeling and design is particularly focused at digital city planning applications that provide innovative “what-if” design tools enabling urban stake holders from cities worldwide to automatically integrate, process, analyze, and visualize the complex interdependencies between the urban form, function, and the natural environment.
